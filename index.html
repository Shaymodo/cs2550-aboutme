        <h2 style="text-align: center;">Ode to a Washing Machine</h2>
        <p style="text-align: center;">I was doing laundry while working on this assignment<br>
            Clothes are all dirty<br>
            I wash them then I dry them<br>
            Now I wear fresh clothes<br>
        </p>

        <h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
        <p>I enjoy martial arts a lot. I was an instructor for a kenpo karate studio for a
            few years and loved it. It helped my learn self defense, but also more
            "performance" arts with weapons such as nunchucks and swords</p>
        <p>I love doing puzzles. I have solved a 3x3 rubiks cube in 15 seconds in the past,
            and can still generally solve one in about 45 seconds. I also enjoy solving the
            many variants of rubiks cubes. Another type of puzzle I enjoy are Hanayama cast
            puzzles,which mostly involves taking pieces of metal apart then putting them
            back together in the proper way.</p>
        <p> I like to do spray paint art as well. I love doing space art the most, and
            making various sizes and styles of planets. However, as much as I love doing
            only space art, my favorite piece of art has been painting the moon above a
            large pine forest with tiny stars in the night sky.</p>
